# HAR-using-image-classification
The notebooks here entail a unique method of human activity recognition where sensor data is converted into Gramian Angular Field images. Convolutional Neural Networks are subsequently used to classify the images. The dataset has 6 labels - 1,2,3,4,5,6; each of them representing one of the 6 activities listed in the UCI-HAR dataset.
